## Why should I care how HPC systems are put together?

* Understanding the different types of HPC hardware allows you to understand why some things are better on one resource than another
* Allows you to choose the appropriate resource for your application
* Allows you to understand the ways to parallelise your serial application
* Gives you an appreciation of the parts that are important for performance

## How are parallel HPC systems constructed

## Typical software use flow on HPC

## Hardware: processors, memeory, disk

## OS, processes and threads
